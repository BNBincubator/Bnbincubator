# BNBin Token

The BNBIN token

BNB is what INCUBATOR eat. Well fed INCUBATOR are happier and produce much more BNB-IN. Just hold $BNBIN in your wallet and your INCUBATOR will automatically consume the BNBIN to produce more BNBIN. BNB-IN is designed to keep sustainable for a very long time. Therefore $BNBIN has a 10% tax rate where 7% get used to fill the pool and make it more sustainable. BNBIN has a fixed "harvest rate" of X and gets consumed by chicken making it an asset that gets more and more deflationary.

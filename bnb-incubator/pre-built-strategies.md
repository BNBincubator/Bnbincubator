# Pre-Built Strategies

Our Pre-Built Strategies Automatic and Manual Strategies

One of the key features of the BNB-IN is the possibility for the holders to choose to use one of the pre-built strategies written directly in the contract or to use their own strategy and compound manually at the time of their choice. The choice of using the pre-built strategies comes with a cost : There is an additional fee of 1% of the amount to deposit or to withdraw. The 6:1 strategy (Recommended) In this strategy, the contract will hatch your eggs (Compound) once a day for 6 days, and then withdraw your eggs in the 7th and send them directly to your wallet in form of BNB. This is the strategy that we recommend to maximize your returns. The 5:1 strategy In this strategy, the contract will hatch your eggs (Compound) once a day for 5 days, and then withdraw your eggs in the 6th and send them directly to your wallet in form of BNB. This strategy is less effective than the 6:1 strategy. Its ROI is still very decent. The 4:1 strategy In this strategy, the contract will hatch your eggs (Compound) once a day for 4 days, and then withdraw your eggs in the 5th and send them directly to your wallet in form of BNB. Since you're eating eggs more frequently, you can expect less rewards. The 0:1 strategy (Not recommended) In this strategy, the contract will withdraws your eggs everyday sends them directly to your wallet in form of BNB. This is the worst strategy ever, and we don't recommended using it since you'll be getting the lowest rewards.

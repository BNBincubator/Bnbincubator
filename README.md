# ðŸŒŸ Overview

## BNB INCUBATOR

BNB incubator is an egg incubator with a huge **APY 3.562%** where we will reward our investors with daily returns of **5% to 8%**, according to the selected eggs.

Our APY is fully dynamic, where its mining is by trading volume, with this we are able to ensure profit to our investors and above all sustainability.

****\
**BNB-IN is designed to keep sustainable for a very long time.**

Therefore BNB-IN has a **10% tax** rate where **7%** get used to fill the pool and make it more sustainable. BNB-IN has a fixed "harvest rate" of X and gets consumed by chicken making it an asset that gets more and more deflationary.

**See our incubators**

Each incubator is unique with different earning properties.
